Portfolio Description

I've chosen to include SpaceMath! in my portfolio because this project gave me a glimpse into 
what working in the industry is like. For context, this project was structured to simulate a 
real world software engineering environment. On the first day of class, we were assigned groups,
assigned a project, and told that we would have three releases throughout the semester with the 
third release being our final product. This project was invaluable to me because I learned not only
how to work both individually and in a group setting but also several concepts and procedures that 
are commonly used in a software engineering setting. SpaceMath! was also valuable because I got to
experience connecting a frontend Actionscript application to a backend PHP/Flox application as well
as hosting our server on a Raspberry Pi.
